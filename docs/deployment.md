# Deployment

Thirdlight runs as plain Node processes inside the owner's Proxmox LXC. No
containers, no reverse proxy required. Everything below is what the
repository actually does today; the commands are the ones the tests run.

## Requirements

- Node 22 (the LXC has v22.22.1), git.
- This shell exports `NODE_ENV=production`, which makes npm skip dev
  dependencies. Install with:

```sh
NODE_ENV=development npm ci --include=dev
```

## Start

```sh
npm start                      # = node tools/start.mjs
```

On the first run this builds `dist/` if needed, creates the data root
`~/thirdlight` (projects under `projects/`, exports under `exports/`,
backups under `backups/`), writes the owner token to
`~/thirdlight/owner-token` (mode 0600) and starts the backend on ports 8501
(editor + API) and 8502 (play preview). It prints:

```
Thirdlight is running.
  editor:   http://127.0.0.1:8501/#token=<token>
  projects: /home/dadmin/thirdlight/projects
  token:    /home/dadmin/thirdlight/owner-token
  MCP:      THIRDLIGHT_AUTHORING_ORIGIN=... THIRDLIGHT_MCP_TOKEN=<the token> node .../mcp.mjs ...
```

Open the printed URL. On a terminal it carries the token
(`#token=...`); when the output is not a terminal (systemd, a log file) the
token is left out and the page asks for it once. The browser stores the token in localStorage; after
that `http://127.0.0.1:8501/` is enough. Ctrl+C stops the backend cleanly
(projects are released for the next start).

Options: `--data-root DIR`, `--port N`, `--preview-port N`, `--build`
(rebuild `dist/` first), `--host HOST`.

**Reaching it from another machine.** The backend allows only exact
origins and the play preview embeds the editor origin, so the browser must
use the origin the backend was started with. Start with the name or address
the browser will use:

```sh
node tools/start.mjs --host 192.168.1.20
# open http://192.168.1.20:8501/#token=<token>
```

This binds 0.0.0.0. There is no TLS and one shared owner token: keep it on a
trusted LAN.

## Run it as a service (systemd)

`deploy/thirdlight.service` runs the start script as `dadmin` at boot,
restarting on failure. It is installed on this LXC (`Pi-CT`, 10.0.10.223):

```sh
sudo cp deploy/thirdlight.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now thirdlight
systemctl status thirdlight            # state
journalctl -u thirdlight -n 50         # the printed editor URL (without the token)
sudo systemctl restart thirdlight      # after a rebuild
```

Edit `--host` in the unit if the address browsers use changes. The editor
is then at `http://10.0.10.223:8501/` (token from
`~/thirdlight/owner-token`). The journal never gets the token. Builds
before 2026-09-23 printed it there; if yours did, rotate the token (see
below).

## Behind a reverse proxy

The backend accepts only the exact origins it was started with, and the
play preview is isolated from the editor by origin, so a proxy needs **two
hostnames**: one forwarded to the editor port (8501, WebSocket upgrades
included) and one to the preview port (8502). Tell the start script the
public origins the browser will use:

```sh
node tools/start.mjs --origin https://editor.example --preview-origin https://play.example
```

A single proxied hostname cannot work: the editor's requests arrive with
the proxy's origin and are refused with `bad_origin`, and the preview
iframe must load from a different origin than the editor.

## The owner token

There is exactly one token. It is the `Authorization: Bearer` credential
for the editor, the MCP server and the admin routes. Rotate it by deleting
`~/thirdlight/owner-token` and restarting (browsers then ask for the new
one; the picker has "Forget the access token in this browser").

## Projects

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8501/` for the picker: it lists every project under
`~/thirdlight/projects/` and every registered folder project (see "Projects
in a game's own folder"), and creates new ones, empty or from a template.
Templates are directories under the engine's `templates/` or `samples/`
holding `captured/project.json` (+ `assets/`, optional `template.json` with
`name`, `description`, `requiredModules`). `samples/beacon-reach` is the
one shipped today.

A project directory is `project.json`, `scenes/main.json` (the scene +
content envelope) and `sources/sha256/<digest>` (imported asset and script
sources; a folder project's assets can instead stay in the game folder, see
"Assets referenced in place"). `.thirdlight/` is process state (ownership,
recovery, staging, derived caches); it is not part of a backup.

## MCP (coding harness)

The MCP server is `dist/mcp-adapter/mcp.mjs` over stdio. Register it once,
for every project, in Claude Code's user scope:

```sh
claude mcp add --scope user thirdlight -- sh -c 'THIRDLIGHT_MCP_TOKEN=$(cat ~/thirdlight/owner-token) THIRDLIGHT_AUTHORING_ORIGIN=http://127.0.0.1:8501 exec node /home/dadmin/projects/thirdlight/dist/mcp-adapter/mcp.mjs'
```

Without `THIRDLIGHT_PROJECT_ID` the server works on the folder project the
harness runs in: on the first tool call it asks the backend which registered
project holds the nearest `thirdlight.json` at or above its working folder
(so a session in `~/projects/my-game/src` works on `my-game`). This needs the
harness and the backend on the same filesystem. Outside any project folder,
or in a folder the backend does not know, the tools return an error saying
what to do. Setting `THIRDLIGHT_PROJECT_ID=<id>` pins the server to one
project instead (needed for projects in the data root).

Optional: `THIRDLIGHT_MCP_CLIENT_ID` (recorded as the command origin),
`THIRDLIGHT_MCP_TIMEOUT_MS`. The tools are listed by the server
(`tl_inspect`, `tl_command`, `tl_diagnostics`, `tl_sessions`,
`tl_play_start`/`tl_play_stop`, `tl_input_exercise`, `tl_game_control`,
`tl_game_observe`, `tl_screenshot`, `tl_content_upload`, `tl_content_job`,
`tl_content_query`). Play tools need an editor browser
connected to the project; without one they return `session_unavailable`.

## Backup and restore

Stop the backend (or release the project through
`POST /api/v1/admin/projects/<id>/release`) first; a project a running
backend owns is refused.

```sh
node tools/backup.mjs create my-game            # -> ~/thirdlight/backups/my-game-<UTC stamp>/
node tools/backup.mjs verify ~/thirdlight/backups/my-game-20260922T120000Z
node tools/backup.mjs list
node tools/backup.mjs restore ~/thirdlight/backups/my-game-20260922T120000Z            # same id; refuses if it exists
node tools/backup.mjs restore ~/thirdlight/backups/my-game-20260922T120000Z --as my-game-2
```

A backup is a directory: the project's files plus `backup-manifest.json`
(SHA-256 inventory, written last). Copy the directory anywhere; `tar czf`
it if you want one file. Nothing is pruned automatically. `--data-root` and
`--out` override the locations.

## Projects in a game's own folder

A project can live in the game's own folder (its git repository) instead of
the data root. One backend serves all projects; `~/thirdlight/registry.json`
maps each such project id to its folder. The folder holds:

- `thirdlight.json` — the marker: project id, name, the subfolder name and
  the engine pin (version, git commit, lockfile digest);
- `thirdlight/` — the project files (the same layout as above) and a
  `.gitignore` keeping `.thirdlight/` process state out of git. Commit the
  marker and `thirdlight/`.

In the picker, "Folder on the server" under New project creates one (the
folder may not exist yet; it may not overlap the data root or another
project); "Open project folder" registers an existing folder holding a
`thirdlight.json`; "remove" on a folder project forgets it and never touches
its files. A registered folder that goes missing is listed as "folder
unavailable" until it is back. From the shell, with the backend running:

```sh
node tools/project.mjs create ~/projects/my-game --id my-game --name "My game" [--template beacon-reach]
node tools/project.mjs register ~/projects/my-game       # an existing folder
node tools/project.mjs unregister my-game                 # files are kept
node tools/project.mjs list
node tools/project.mjs check ~/projects/my-game [--repin] # this engine vs the pin (offline)
node tools/project.mjs export ~/projects/my-game --out ~/projects/my-game/build
```

`--origin` and `--token-file` override `http://127.0.0.1:8501` and
`~/thirdlight/owner-token`. The engine pin is advisory in the editor: a
different version or lockfile is shown in the picker and in Problems, a
different commit alone is normal after an upgrade; the project still opens.
`project.mjs export` refuses a version or lockfile mismatch unless
`--force`; `check --repin` records this engine once you have checked the
game. The export is a static directory that needs nothing else.

### Assets referenced in place

In a folder project, an asset can stay where the game keeps it (for example
`assets/env/kit/meadow/env_kit_meadow.glb`, built by a script, in Git LFS)
instead of being copied into `thirdlight/sources/`. The asset version records
the file's path relative to the game folder and its SHA-256; nothing is
copied. Projects in the data root keep copying uploads as before.

- **Import.** Assets tab → "from project folder…" opens a picker limited to
  the game folder (it starts in `assets/`; hidden entries, `.git` and
  `thirdlight/` are not offered, and a symlink that leads out of the folder is
  refused). "reimport from folder…" records a file as a new version of the
  selected asset. The MCP server does the same:
  `tl_content_query {target:"projectFiles", dir:"assets"}` lists a folder,
  `tl_content_upload {projectPath:"assets/props/crate.glb"}` inspects the file
  in place and returns `sourcePath`, and `tl_command publishAsset` with
  `sourcePath` in its args records it — the same command the editor sends.
  Paths are always relative to the folder holding `thirdlight.json`.
- **Reads are verified.** Every read (the editor view, Play, export) checks
  that the file is still inside the game folder and still has the recorded
  SHA-256. A changed file is `asset_source_changed`, a missing one
  `asset_source_missing`; other bytes are never used.
- **When a file changes** (a Blender rebuild): the editor checks the files
  when it opens a project, when its window gets focus back, after each import
  and on "check files" in Problems. Problems then says which asset and file
  changed and offers **Re-import**, which records a new version with the new
  bytes as one undoable command. There is no file watcher: the check on focus
  covers switching back from Blender, rebuild scripts write many files at
  once, and the reads are verified anyway. Older versions of that asset can
  no longer be read once the file changed; Problems says so. They stay in the
  history, and come back if the old bytes do (for example `git checkout`).
- **Play and export** copy the referenced bytes into the play build and the
  standalone game (`content/sha256/<digest>`), so an export needs no editor,
  backend or game folder. With a changed or missing file, Play and export
  refuse and name the file (export: `export_scene_invalid` with
  `reason: asset_source_changed`).
- **Backups** of a folder project hold the whole game folder, so the
  referenced files are in them (see "Backups find folder projects" below).

### Supported glTF extensions

GLB is the only model format the game loads. Besides core glTF 2.0 the
importer accepts these extensions (each has a fixture in `fixtures/import-ext`
that imports, and renders in the editor, Play and the export):

- `EXT_texture_webp` (what the Blender pipeline writes), `KHR_texture_transform`,
  `KHR_mesh_quantization`, `KHR_materials_unlit` and the material extensions
  `clearcoat`, `emissive_strength`, `ior`, `sheen`, `specular`, `transmission`
  and `volume`;
- compression: `EXT_meshopt_compression` (the importer decodes it itself and
  checks the decoded data), `KHR_draco_mesh_compression` and
  `KHR_texture_basisu` (KTX2 / Basis Universal GPU textures). Draco and KTX2
  payloads are checked for structure, header and declared sizes at import and
  decoded when the model loads; a stream that does not decode shows in
  Problems ("view") in the editor.

Any other extension is refused at import with `asset_extension_unsupported`,
naming it; an allowlisted extension in a place where it would mean nothing, or
not declared in `extensionsUsed`, is refused too.

### FBX

An `.fbx` can be imported like a `.glb` (upload, "from project folder…", or
MCP `tl_content_upload` with `dataBase64` or `projectPath`). The backend
converts it with headless Blender (`THIRDLIGHT_BLENDER`, default `blender` on
`PATH`; this LXC has Blender 5.2.2 in `/usr/local/bin`, which the systemd
unit's default `PATH` includes) into a GLB — Y up, animations kept, textures
embedded — and that GLB goes through the same import profile. The game only
ever loads GLB:

- the converted GLB is the version's stored bytes (`thirdlight/sources/`), so
  Play and export never need Blender or the FBX;
- the FBX is recorded as the version's original (`convertedFrom`: checksum,
  size, the Blender version, and its path when it is in the game folder; an
  uploaded FBX is stored as a blob next to the GLB). An FBX in the game folder
  stays where it is; textures next to it are found by Blender;
- when the FBX changes, Problems says so and offers **Re-import**, which
  converts it again into a new version. Until then Play and export keep using
  the previous conversion (unlike a referenced GLB, the stored GLB stays
  readable). A missing FBX is only noted;
- one conversion runs at a time and is stopped after 3 minutes; an FBX in the
  folder may be up to 128 MB, an upload up to the 32 MB stage limit. Without
  Blender an FBX import fails with `converter_unavailable`; a file Blender
  cannot convert with `conversion_failed` (with Blender's reason).

Animations survive the conversion, but a model's animations only play in the
game through a role binding (Media panel), as for any GLB.

The Draco and Basis decoders are three's own (`three@0.186.0`,
`examples/jsm/libs/{draco,basis}`, Apache-2.0). The editor and the Play
preview serve them at `/decoders/`; an export gets a `decoders/` folder (and a
license row in `meta.json`) only when one of its models needs it. Both run in
Web Workers, so the Play preview allows `worker-src blob:`; the Basis
transcoder also builds functions at run time, so a Play whose models carry a
KTX2 texture is served with `'unsafe-eval'` added to its script policy (other
Plays are not).

Backups find folder projects through the registry and copy the **whole game
folder**: the marker, `thirdlight/`, the assets, art sources and `.git` —
everything except Thirdlight's process state (`thirdlight/.thirdlight/`).
The game folder is the bound; nothing outside it belongs to the project.
`--out` may not point inside the game folder. Such a backup restores only
into a new or empty folder, then you register it:

```sh
node tools/backup.mjs restore ~/thirdlight/backups/my-game-20260922T120000Z --folder ~/projects/my-game-restored [--as my-game-2]
node tools/project.mjs register ~/projects/my-game-restored
```

## Upgrade

```sh
node tools/backup.mjs create <each project>       # with the backend stopped
git pull
NODE_ENV=development npm ci --include=dev
npm start -- --build
node tools/project.mjs check ~/projects/<game>    # per folder project; --repin once verified
```

## Verification

```sh
npm test                                    # unit + integration (vitest)
npm run build && npm run test:e2e           # Playwright: real backend + Chromium
```

The browser tests need Playwright's Chromium (`npx playwright install
chromium`); on this LXC they use the library tree described in
`tests/e2e/browser-env.mjs`.
